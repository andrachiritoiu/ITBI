In this project, I implemented a shell script that monitors active users on a Linux system. The script creates a directory for each active user, containing a file named procs, which lists the user's currently running processes. The user information is updated periodically, and for users who are no longer active, the script creates an empty procs file and an additional file called lastlogin, which displays the date of the user's last session.
